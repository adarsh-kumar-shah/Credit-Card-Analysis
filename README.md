# Credit Card Analysis

## Project Overview
I built two interactive Power BI dashboards to get a clear look at who's using credit cards and how they’re actually spending their money. 
By digging into demographics, income, and spending habits, I turned raw data into stories that show exactly how customers behave

The dashboards were designed as part of a Power BI analytics project to demonstrate data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard storytelling skills.

## Objectives
- To visualize key customer metrics such as demographics, income, and card usage.  
- To analyze transaction trends by expenditure type, week, and card category.  
- To enable interactive exploration through filters and slicers for:
  - Gender 
  - Age Group 
  - Income Group 
  - Card Category
  - Transaction Week
  - Expense Type  

## Data Modeling & Transformations
- Merged customer and transaction datasets using Customer_ID as the primary key.
- Performed data cleaning and transformation in Power Query.
- Created calculated columns and measures using DAX, including:
  - Age Group
  - Income Group
  - Total Revenue
  - Credit Usage %
  - Week Number
  - Current Week Revenue
  - Previous Week Revenue
  - WoW Growth %
